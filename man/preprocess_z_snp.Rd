\usage{
preprocess_z_snp(
  z_snp,
  snp_map,
  drop_multiallelic = TRUE,
  drop_strand_ambig = TRUE,
  logfile = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{z_snp}{A data frame with two columns: "id", "A1", "A2", "z". giving the z scores for
snps. "A1" is effect allele. "A2" is the other allele.}

\item{snp_map}{a list of data frames with SNP-to-region map for the reference.}

\item{drop_multiallelic}{If TRUE, multiallelic variants will be dropped from the summary statistics.}

\item{drop_strand_ambig}{If TRUE remove strand ambiguous variants (A/T, G/C).}

\item{logfile}{The log filename. If NULL, print log info on screen.}
}
\value{
a data frame preprocessed GWAS z-scores
}
