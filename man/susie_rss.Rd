\arguments{
\item{z}{A p-vector of z scores.}

\item{R}{A p by p symmetric, positive semidefinite correlation
matrix.}

\item{maf}{Minor allele frequency; to be used along with
\code{maf_thresh} to filter input summary statistics.}

\item{maf_thresh}{Variants having a minor allele frequency smaller
than this threshold are not used.}

\item{z_ld_weight}{This feature is not recommended. The weights
assigned to the z scores in the LD matrix. If \code{z_ld_weight >
0}, the LD matrix used in the model is \code{cov2cor((1-w)*R +
w*tcrossprod(z))}, where \code{w = z_ld_weight}.}

\item{L}{Number of components (nonzero coefficients) in the susie
regression model. If L is larger than the number of covariates, p,
L is set to p.}

\item{prior_variance}{The prior variance. It is either a scalar or
a vector of length L.}

\item{residual_variance}{Variance of the residual.
If it is not specified, we set it to 1.}

\item{prior_weights}{A vector of length p, in which each entry
gives the prior probability that SNP j has non-zero effect.}

\item{null_weight}{Prior probability of no effect (a number between
0 and 1, and cannot be exactly 1).}

\item{estimate_residual_variance}{The residual variance is
fixed to the value supplied by \code{residual_variance}. We don't
estimate residual variance in susie_rss.}

\item{estimate_prior_variance}{If \code{estimate_prior_variance =
TRUE}, the prior variance is estimated (this is a separate
parameter for each of the L effects). If provided,
\code{prior_variance} is then used as an initial value for
the optimization. When \code{estimate_prior_variance = FALSE}, the
prior variance for each of the L effects is determined by the
value supplied to \code{prior_variance}.}

\item{estimate_prior_method}{The method used for estimating prior
variance. When \code{estimate_prior_method = "simple"} is used, the
likelihood at the specified prior variance is compared to the
likelihood at a variance of zero, and the setting with the larger
likelihood is retained.}

\item{check_null_threshold}{When the prior variance is estimated,
compare the estimate with the null, and set the prior variance to
zero unless the log-likelihood using the estimate is larger by this
threshold amount. For example, if you set
\code{check_null_threshold = 0.1}, this will "nudge" the estimate
towards zero when the difference in log-likelihoods is small. A
note of caution that setting this to a value greater than zero may
lead the IBSS fitting procedure to occasionally decrease the ELBO.}

\item{prior_tol}{When the prior variance is estimated, compare the
estimated value to \code{prior_tol} at the end of the computation,
and exclude a single effect from PIP computation if the estimated
prior variance is smaller than this tolerance value.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of IBSS iterations to perform.}

\item{s_init}{A previous susie fit with which to initialize.}

\item{intercept_value}{The intercept. (The intercept cannot be
estimated from centered summary data.) This setting will be used by
\code{coef} to assign an intercept value, mainly for consistency
with \code{susie}. Set to \code{NULL} if you want \code{coef} not
to include an intercept term (and so only a p-vector is returned).}

\item{coverage}{A number between 0 and 1 specifying the
\dQuote{coverage} of the estimated confidence sets.}

\item{min_abs_corr}{Minimum absolute correlation allowed in a
credible set. The default, 0.5, corresponds to a squared
correlation of 0.25, which is a commonly used threshold for
genotype data in genetic studies.}

\item{tol}{A small, non-negative number specifying the convergence
tolerance for the IBSS fitting procedure. The fitting procedure
will halt when the difference in the variational lower bound, or
\dQuote{ELBO} (the objective function to be maximized), is
less than \code{tol}.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{verbose = TRUE}, the algorithm's progress,
and a summary of the optimization settings, are printed to the
console.}

\item{track_fit}{If \code{track_fit = TRUE}, \code{trace}
is also returned containing detailed information about the
estimates at each iteration of the IBSS fitting procedure.}

\item{check_R}{If \code{check_R = TRUE}, check that \code{R} is
positive semidefinite.}

\item{r_tol}{Tolerance level for eigenvalue check of positive
semidefinite matrix of R.}

\item{refine}{If \code{refine = TRUE}, we use a procedure to help
SuSiE get out of local optimum.}

\item{warn_converge_fail}{If \code{warn_converge_fail = TRUE},
prints a warning message when IBSS algorithm does not converge.}
}
\value{
A \code{"susie"} object with some or all of the following
  elements:

\item{alpha}{An L by p matrix of posterior inclusion probabilites.}

\item{mu}{An L by p matrix of posterior means, conditional on
  inclusion.}

\item{mu2}{An L by p matrix of posterior second moments,
  conditional on inclusion.}

\item{lbf}{log-Bayes Factor for each single effect.}

\item{lbf_variable}{log-Bayes Factor for each variable and single effect.}

\item{sigma2}{Fixed Residual variance.}

\item{V}{Prior variance of the non-zero elements of b, equal to
  \code{scaled_prior_variance * var(Y)}.}

\item{elbo}{The value of the variational lower bound, or
  \dQuote{ELBO} (objective function to be maximized), achieved at
  each iteration of the IBSS fitting procedure.}

\item{fitted}{Vector of length n containing the fitted values of
  the outcome.}

\item{sets}{Credible sets estimated from model fit; see
  \code{\link{susie_get_cs}} for details.}

  inclusion probabilities for all p covariates.}

\item{niter}{Number of IBSS iterations that were performed.}

\item{converged}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} indicating whether
  the IBSS converged to a solution within the chosen tolerance
  level.}

  \%*\% colSums(alpha*mu)}.}
}
\description{
\code{susie_rss} performs sum of single-effect linear
  regression with z scores; all posterior calculations are for
  z-scores. This function fits the regression model \eqn{z = \sum_l
  R*b_l + e}, where e is \eqn{N(0,R)} and \eqn{\sum_l b_l} is a
  p-vector of effects to be estimated. The required summary data are
  the p by p correlation matrix, \code{R}, and the p-vector \code{z}.
